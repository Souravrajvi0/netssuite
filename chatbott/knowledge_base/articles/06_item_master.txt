EXAMPLE CONFIGURATION:

Item: Laptop Computer
├── HSN Code: 8471
├── Nature: Goods
├── GST Unit: NOS
├── GST Unit Code: NOS
└── Tax Rate: 18%

When this item is added to an invoice:
- HSN Code automatically fills: 8471
- Nature automatically sets: Goods
- GST Unit automatically sets: NOS
- Tax Code automatically selects: CGST/SGST @ 18% (intra-state) or IGST @ 18% (inter-state)

BEST PRACTICES:

- Configure GST details on all items before going live
- Use correct HSN/SAC codes (verify with govt. portal)
- Set appropriate GST units and codes
- Review and update items periodically
- Train users on item selection for accuracy
- Maintain item master documentation
- Test items on transactions after setup

COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:

- Wrong HSN/SAC code selection
- Incorrect nature of item (Goods vs Services)
- Missing GST unit codes
- Wrong tax rate configuration
- Not updating items when rates change

IMPORTANT NOTES:

- Item-level setup is optional but highly recommended
- Can override item defaults on transaction if needed
- Changes to item master don't affect past transactions
- Regular review needed when GST rates change
- Proper setup reduces transaction processing time
- Critical for accurate GSTR-1 HSN summary reporting

TAX GROUPS SETUP

Purpose: Combine multiple tax codes (CGST + SGST or IGST) into consolidated groups.

Navigation Path: Setup > Accounting > Tax Groups > New

CONFIGURATION STEPS:

1. Select Country: India

2. Enter Tax Name (e.g., "CGST/SGST @ 18%")

3. Add tax code lines:
   - Select individual tax codes (e.g., CGST @ 9%, SGST @ 9%)
   - Specify rate for each
   - Set basis to 100
   - Assign tax type

Result: The consolidated rate (e.g., 18%) displays automatically at the group level.

KEY FEATURE: 
The system calculates the combined rate based on line-level selections.

COMMON TAX GROUP CONFIGURATIONS:

For Intra-State Transactions:
- CGST/SGST @ 5% (CGST 2.5% + SGST 2.5%)
- CGST/SGST @ 12% (CGST 6% + SGST 6%)
- CGST/SGST @ 18% (CGST 9% + SGST 9%)
- CGST/SGST @ 28% (CGST 14% + SGST 14%)

For Inter-State Transactions:
- IGST @ 5%
- IGST @ 12%
- IGST @ 18%
- IGST @ 28%

TAX GROUP STRUCTURE:

Tax Group: CGST/SGST @ 18%
├── Line 1: CGST @ 9% (Basis: 100)
└── Line 2: SGST @ 9% (Basis: 100)
Total: 18%

Tax Group: IGST @ 18%
└── Line 1: IGST @ 18% (Basis: 100)
Total: 18%

WHY USE TAX GROUPS:

1. Simplification: Users select one tax group instead of multiple tax codes
2. Accuracy: Ensures correct combination of CGST+SGST
3. Compliance: Maintains proper tax splitting for returns
4. Consistency: Standardizes tax application across transactions

BEST PRACTICES:

- Create separate tax groups for each rate (5%, 12%, 18%, 28%)
- Name tax groups clearly indicating rate and components
- Create both intra-state (CGST/SGST) and inter-state (IGST) versions
- Test tax groups on sample transactions before deployment
- Document tax group mapping for user training

IMPORTANT NOTES:

- Tax groups are required for proper GST calculation
- System automatically selects appropriate group based on location
- Always verify the consolidated rate matches expected total
- Tax groups simplify transaction entry for users

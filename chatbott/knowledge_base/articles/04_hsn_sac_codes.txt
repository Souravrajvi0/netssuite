HSN/SAC CODE CREATION

Purpose: Define Harmonized System of Nomenclature (HSN) codes for goods and Service Accounting Codes (SAC) for services.

Navigation Path: AG Taxation > Master Data > HSN/SAC List > New

REQUIRED FIELDS:

1. Code: HSN/SAC number (e.g., 999622)
2. Type: SAC or HSN
3. Tax Rate: Under Tax Rate Details subtab (e.g., 18.0%)

OPTIONAL FIELDS:

- Description: Product/service description
- From Date: Effective start date
- To Date: Effective end date

KEY NOTES: 
Tax rates defined here will auto-populate on transactions when the HSN/SAC code is selected.

HSN vs SAC:

HSN (Harmonized System of Nomenclature):
- Used for goods/products
- 4, 6, or 8 digit classification system
- Example: 8471 (Computers and peripheral equipment)

SAC (Service Accounting Code):
- Used for services
- 6-digit classification system
- Example: 998314 (Information technology consulting services)

COMMON HSN CODES:

- 3004: Medicaments
- 8471: Computers
- 8517: Telephone sets, smartphones
- 8703: Motor cars
- 9403: Furniture

COMMON SAC CODES:

- 995411: Accounting and bookkeeping services
- 996812: Insurance services
- 998311: Software design and development
- 998314: IT consulting
- 999622: Management consulting services

HSN/SAC CODE STRUCTURE:

For Goods (HSN):
- First 2 digits: Chapter (e.g., 84 = Machinery)
- Next 2 digits: Heading (e.g., 8471 = Computers)
- Next 2 digits: Sub-heading (optional)
- Last 2 digits: Tariff item (optional)

For Services (SAC):
- 99: Service indicator
- Next 2 digits: Main service category
- Last 2 digits: Detailed service type

TAX RATE CONFIGURATION:

Under Tax Rate Details subtab:
1. Enter applicable GST rate (5%, 12%, 18%, 28%)
2. Rate will auto-populate when code is selected on transactions
3. Multiple rates can be configured with effective dates

BENEFITS OF HSN/SAC SETUP:

1. Auto-population: Tax rates automatically fill on transactions
2. Compliance: Ensures correct classification for returns
3. Reporting: Required for GSTR-1 HSN summary
4. Accuracy: Reduces manual entry errors
5. Audit Trail: Complete product/service classification

BEST PRACTICES:

- Research correct HSN/SAC codes before setup
- Include detailed descriptions for user reference
- Configure tax rates accurately
- Use effective dates for rate changes
- Regular review and update for new products/services
- Maintain master list document for reference

IMPORTANT NOTES:

- HSN/SAC codes are mandatory for GST compliance
- Codes must be selected on all taxable transactions
- Incorrect classification can lead to compliance issues
- System validates HSN/SAC format during entry
- Update codes when government revises classification

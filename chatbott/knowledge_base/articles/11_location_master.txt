LOCATION MASTER CONFIGURATION

Purpose: Define company locations/branches with GSTIN for multi-location GST compliance.

Navigation Path: Setup > Company > Locations > New

CONFIGURATION STEPS:

1. Basic Information:
   - Name: Location identifier (mandatory)
   - Parent Location: If hierarchical
   - Subsidiaries: Select entities
   - Include Children: Checkbox (includes all child subsidiaries)
   - Location Type: Classification
   - Time Zone: Select timezone (e.g., GMT - London)
   - Latitude: Geo-coordinate
   - Longitude: Geo-coordinate
   - Document Number Prefix: For sequential numbering

2. Address Details (Body Level):
   - Click "Map Edit"
   - Country: India
   - Address Lines: Enter address
   - City: City name
   - State: Select state
   - ZIP: Postal code

3. GST Configuration (Body Level - Mandatory):
   - GSTIN: 15-character GST number
   - GST State: Select state
   - GST State Code: Auto-populated
   - Company Registration: Registration number
   - Branch ID: Branch identifier

4. Address Subtab GST Details (Critical):
   - Click "Map Edit" under address
   - Enter same GST details again:
     * GSTIN: Same as body level
     * GST State: Same as body level
     * GST State Code: Same as body level
     * Override: Checkbox if needed

5. Additional Fields:
   - Return Address: Map Edit option
   - Logo: Upload location logo
   - Location is Inactive: Checkbox
   
   - Click Save

CRITICAL NOTE:
GST details must be entered in TWO places:
1. Body level
2. Address subtab

Both entries are required for proper tax calculation.
This applies to both new and existing locations.

USAGE: 
Location selection on transactions determines which GSTIN is used for tax calculation (intra-state vs inter-state).

WHY MULTI-LOCATION SETUP:

Companies with multiple branches need:
- Separate GSTIN for each state
- Location-wise compliance
- Branch-level reporting
- Accurate tax calculation

Without proper location setup:
- Wrong GSTIN on invoices
- Incorrect tax type (CGST/SGST vs IGST)
- Compliance issues
- ITC claim problems

LOCATION HIERARCHY:

Parent Location: India Operations
├── Child Location: Mumbai Branch
│   └── GSTIN: 27XXXXX (Maharashtra)
├── Child Location: Delhi Branch
│   └── GSTIN: 07XXXXX (Delhi)
└── Child Location: Bangalore Branch
    └── GSTIN: 29XXXXX (Karnataka)

TAX CALCULATION LOGIC:

Location GSTIN vs Customer GSTIN:

Same State Transaction:
├── Location: Mumbai (27XXXXX)
├── Customer: Pune (27YYYYY)
└── Tax Applied: CGST + SGST (Intra-state)

Different State Transaction:
├── Location: Mumbai (27XXXXX)
├── Customer: Delhi (07YYYYY)
└── Tax Applied: IGST (Inter-state)

CONFIGURATION EXAMPLE:

Location: Mumbai Head Office
├── Name: Mumbai HO
├── Parent: India Operations
├── Subsidiaries: ABC India Pvt Ltd
├── Time Zone: (GMT+05:30) India Standard Time
│
├── Address (Body Level):
│   ├── Address: 123 Business Park
│   ├── City: Mumbai
│   ├── State: Maharashtra
│   └── ZIP: 400001
│
├── GST Configuration (Body Level):
│   ├── GSTIN: 27AABCA1234C1Z5
│   ├── GST State: Maharashtra
│   ├── GST State Code: 27
│   └── Branch ID: MUM001
│
└── Address Subtab:
    └── GST Details (Must duplicate):
        ├── GSTIN: 27AABCA1234C1Z5
        ├── GST State: Maharashtra
        └── GST State Code: 27

COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:

❌ Entering GST details only at body level
✅ Must enter at both body level AND address subtab

❌ Different GSTIN at body vs address level
✅ Same GSTIN must be entered in both places

❌ Missing GST state code
✅ Always configure state code

❌ Wrong state selection
✅ Verify state matches GSTIN

IMPACT ON TRANSACTIONS:

Invoice Creation:
1. User selects location: "Mumbai HO"
2. System fetches location GSTIN: 27XXXXX
3. Compares with customer GSTIN
4. Determines tax type:
   - Same state → CGST + SGST
   - Different state → IGST

Vendor Bill Creation:
1. User selects location: "Delhi Branch"
2. System fetches location GSTIN: 07XXXXX
3. Compares with vendor GSTIN
4. Determines ITC eligibility and tax type

LOCATION-WISE REPORTING:

GSTR-1 (Sales):
- Filed separately for each location
- Location GSTIN as identifier
- Branch-wise compliance

GSTR-2 (Purchases):
- Location-wise input credit
- Proper ITC attribution
- Branch-level reporting

GSTR-3B (Summary):
- Separate filing per location
- Location-wise tax liability
- Branch compliance tracking

BEST PRACTICES:

1. Setup Process:
   - Create location before transactions
   - Enter GST details in both places
   - Verify state code auto-population
   - Test with sample transaction

2. Naming Convention:
   - Use clear location identifiers
   - Include city/state in name
   - Maintain hierarchy if needed

3. Maintenance:
   - Regular GSTIN validation
   - Update when branches open/close
   - Deactivate instead of deleting
   - Document location changes

4. User Training:
   - Train teams on location selection
   - Explain impact on tax calculation
   - Provide location selection guide
   - Regular refresher sessions

TROUBLESHOOTING:

Issue: Tax calculating incorrectly
Solution: Verify GST details at both body and address level

Issue: Location GSTIN not appearing on invoice
Solution: Check address subtab GST configuration

Issue: Wrong tax type (IGST instead of CGST/SGST)
Solution: Verify location and customer state codes match

Issue: Unable to file GSTR-1 for location
Solution: Ensure location GSTIN is properly configured

IMPORTANT NOTES:

- Location configuration is critical for GST compliance
- GST details required at TWO levels (body + address)
- Location determines which GSTIN appears on invoices
- Affects tax type calculation (intra vs inter-state)
- Separate GSTR filing needed for each location
- Changes affect future transactions immediately
- Cannot change GSTIN on existing transactions
- Regular validation recommended
- Deactivate old locations rather than deleting
- Maintain audit trail of location changes
